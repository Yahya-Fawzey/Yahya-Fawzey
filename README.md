# Hi there, I'm Yahya Fawzey 👋

## About Me

I'm a **Computer Science student specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on building **end-to-end ML solutions** that are practical, measurable, and production-aware.  
My interests lie at the intersection of **data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning**, with the long-term goal of operating as a **Machine Learning Scientist** and potentially transitioning into **Machine Learning Engineering**.

I enjoy working with real datasets, asking *why* models behave the way they do, and turning raw data into insights or deployable models. I value clean code, reproducible experiments, and projects that reflect real-world workflows rather than academic toy examples.

- 🔬 Focus: Data Science, Machine Learning, Applied Statistics  
- 🤖 Interested in: ML Scientist & MLE roles  
- 🧠 Strong believer in metrics > accuracy hype  
- 🤝 Open to collaboration on ML-driven projects

### 📊 Electricity Grid Analysis
**Repository:** https://github.com/Yahya-Fawzey/Electricity_Grid_Analysis  
Analyzed hourly electricity grid data from three major U.S. grid operators (CISO, ERCO, and PJM) to identify consumption patterns, inter-regional dynamics, and forecast performance. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Highlights:**
- Ingested and processed **700,000+ records** from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Addressed real-world challenges like **API pagination** and **timezone conversions** for accurate time-series analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover:
  - Daily and seasonal demand patterns  
  - Peak loads across regions  
  - Comparative analysis of forecast accuracy (MAPE) for each grid. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- Used Python tools including **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Requests**. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
