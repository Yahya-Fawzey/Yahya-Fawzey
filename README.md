# Hi there, I'm Yahya Fawzey 👋

## About Me

I'm a **Computer Science student specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on building **end-to-end ML solutions** that are practical, measurable, and production-aware.  
My interests lie at the intersection of **data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning**, with the long-term goal of operating as a **Machine Learning Scientist** and potentially transitioning into **Machine Learning Engineering**.

I enjoy working with real datasets, asking *why* models behave the way they do, and turning raw data into insights or deployable models. I value clean code, reproducible experiments, and projects that reflect real-world workflows rather than academic toy examples.

- 🔬 Focus: Data Science, Machine Learning, Applied Statistics  
- 🤖 Interested in: ML Scientist & MLE roles  
- 🧠 Strong believer in metrics > accuracy hype  
- 🤝 Open to collaboration on ML-driven projects

### ⚡ Electricity Grid Analysis
**Repository:** https://github.com/Yahya-Fawzey/Electricity_Grid_Analysis

An end-to-end data analysis project focused on understanding electricity demand patterns across major U.S. power grids using large-scale, real-world time-series data.

**Key Contributions:**
- Collected and processed **700,000+ hourly records** from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API.
- Handled real-world data engineering challenges such as **API pagination**, **missing values**, and **timezone normalization**.
- Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis to identify:
  - Daily and seasonal demand trends  
  - Regional peak load behavior  
  - Differences between actual demand and forecasted values
- Evaluated forecast performance using **MAPE** to compare grid reliability.
- Built visualizations to clearly communicate insights and patterns.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Requests
